# UK Health Data Assistant

> Conversational AI for UK health data discovery

This project helps researchers find and access UK health datasets through natural language conversation.

## Capabilities

- Dataset discovery by condition, topic, or data type
- Access route guidance for TREs/SDEs
- Dataset comparison (CPRD vs OpenSAFELY, etc.)
- HDR UK Gateway live search
- SAIL Databank register extraction

## Primary Use Cases

1. "What datasets exist for cardiovascular disease?"
2. "Compare CPRD and OpenSAFELY access requirements"
3. "How do I access data through a Trusted Research Environment?"
4. "What data is available for maternal health in Scotland?"

## Key Files

- app.py: Main Streamlit application with chat interface
- system_prompt_v3_structured.txt: AI assistant knowledge base
- extract_sail_data_use_register.py: SAIL data extraction tools

## Integrations

- OpenAI GPT-4o for conversational AI
- HDR UK Gateway API for dataset search
- SAIL Databank for Wales research data

## Data Sources Covered

- HDR UK Innovation Gateway (UK-wide discovery portal)
- CPRD (60M patients, primary care)
- OpenSAFELY (60M patients, COVID research)
- UK Biobank (500K participants, genomics)
- SAIL Databank (Wales, 3.5M population)
- Research Data Scotland (Scotland, 5.5M population)
- Genomics England (rare diseases, cancer)
- NHS England (national data custodian)

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
```

## API Usage
